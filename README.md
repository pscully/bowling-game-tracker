# Bowling Game Tracker

A simple to most but complex to me Javascript project. 

A twofold purpose:

1) To track bowling scores
2) To practice Javascript

I chose an MVC style architecture and this version of the project is written in plain, vanilla Javascript. 

I plan next to implement in both React and Vue. After which I will create a Laravel backend to store the data. 

This code is not professional. Its not production ready. Professional Javascript developers probably know 100 ways to do this better. I don't. 

I am learning and mostly for myself to be able to create mini-projects I have on my mind.
